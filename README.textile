h1. madvertise iOS SDK

h2. Intro

The madvertise iOS SDK lets you monetize your iOS apps via advertising. Basically, the code sends http requests to the madvertise ad server and displays banner ads in various formats. You will receive 100 % of click generated revenues, as we commited to in our [developer fund](http://www.madvertise-fund.com/).

It supports different banner sizes (mma, medium_rectangle, portrait, landscape, fullscreen, leaderboard), ad rotation, in-app landing pages, animated roll-over effects, etc. ...

h2. License

The iOS SDK is using TouchJSON, a library for parsing JSON data (https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchJSON), which is published under the MIT License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

All other code is published under the Apache License 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

h2. Preparations

* Install Xcode

* Install Git

* Clone this repository:
    
    git clone git@github.com:madvertise/madvertise-ios-sdk.git

* Always include the following 4 libraries from Apple in you projects:
  * Foundation.framework
  * UIKit.framework
  * CoreGraphics.framework
  * QuartzCore.framework

* Sign up at [madvertise](https://app.madvertise.de/register)
  * If you don't have already an account, please sign up.
  * Create an app and copy the token, it will identify the requests send to our ad-server.
  * The Sample SDK comes with its own token. You can use it during development and for testing.

h2. Sample App

The SDK comes with a very simple example, how to integrate the SDK in your APP. You can find it at [PROJECT_ROOT]/sample/AnotherSDKTest/. Please make sure to add the required frameworks / libraries and change the build settings accordingly to your development environment.

h2. Using the SDK

* Include the SDK project located at [PROJECT_ROOT]/source/ via "[right-click on root project]/Add/Existing Files ..."

* Add the required frameworks / libraries and change the build settings accordingly to your development environment.

* Embed the MadvertiseView as shown in the sample app.

* Make sure the appId method of your delegate returns the token, that you get when creating an app on our [plattform](https://app.madvertise.de/register).

The [original documentation](http://redmine.madvertise.me/projects/madapi/wiki/IphoneSdk) contains some further information on how to use the SDK.          

h2. About

madvertise is a mobile ad network, that enables developers to monetize their apps via advertising. Banners of various sizes can be placed on mobile websites or directly in applications. The latter is usually done with a SDK in form of a compiled library, that sends requests to an ad-server and display the mobile ad. So far, so good.

But apps are different, developers are, and so are the requirements and wishes, that developers have in order to include advertising in their apps. Additionally, it feels kind of strange, to use foreign librarys in your own code, without being able to actually have a look at the sources.

This is why madvertise decided to make all SDKs public as open source projects. We simply could not handle all the (we admit, pretty good) feature requests and suggestions that developers make. Well, we believe nobody can and that's why we want to share the code with the whole community and enhanced it together. You can adapt the library much more quicker to whatever fits best for you.
